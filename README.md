# GUI Twitter bot 

An application using the twitter API and Electron to provide a simple cross platform method of running a twitter bot without any coding knowledge.

You will need to set up an application key with [twitter developer console](https://developer.twitter.com/). Don't worry it's really simple and the only thing you will need to use my application!

### Spammy Behaviour

Be warned, twitter will block / restrict your application key if you abuse the bot. I would strongly recommend only using this if you a) also use your account for manual tweets, and b) set the bot to run only every few hours.

Of course, you can do what you want!!! But you have been warned!

# Installation

Download the application from [releases](https://github.com/wilburforce83/twitterbotGUI/releases) for the pre packaged .exe file. 

If you prefer to run through [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) you can just clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/wilburforce83/twitterbotGUI.git
cd twitterbotUI
npm install
npm start
```

If running through node the app will work on any platform; Windows, Linux and Mac, it will also run on ChromeOS in developer mode, which is pretty useful.
